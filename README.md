String comparison classes for Fuzzy String Matching
================================

Java implementation of Levenshtein's edit distance algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wava iki/Levenshtein_distance) with a small tweak to return a percentage as a match value.

Java implementation of Dice Coefficient (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) with a small tweak to return a percentage as a match value.

100% (1.0) is an exact match, 0% is completely different.
